websockets
==========

This project is for a websocket server in C

Current Requirements
====================
<ol>
	<li>GNU GCC compiler</li>
	<li>PHP >= 5.3.13 in windows PATH</li>
</ol>

<hr>
Some of the code must be changed due to this program being developed for use from a specific directory.
This will be changed over time while I make the files more dynamic.
I eventually plan to get rid of the PHP files and replace them with a C version of database connection.
In the meantime feel free to use and alter this project however you see fit.
